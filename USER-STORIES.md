# User Stories for Med.AI

This is a backlog of user stories for Med.AI, a web application that deploys AI agents to complete clinical tasks in radiation oncology. These user stories reflect both currently implemented features and planned enhancements, with a focus on streamlining clinical workflows and improving efficiency.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in Med.AI and featured on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a healthcare provider, I want to use LLMs to analyze patient documents and generate one-liners, so I can quickly assess and document patient conditions.

2. As a radiation oncologist, I want to automatically generate and view contours on CT scans using an AI model, so I can streamline the treatment planning process and ensure consistency.

3. As a dosimetrist, I want the AI to suggest optimal treatment plans based on patient data and contours, so I can streamline the planning process while maintaining quality.

### Other Features

4. As a clinician, I want to integrate Med.AI with our existing clinical systems (e.g., Orthanc PACS), so we can maintain a seamless workflow.

5. As a medical resident, I want to view and compare multiple AI-generated responses for patient documentation, so I can select the most accurate and appropriate summary.

6. As a medical professional, I want to monitor the progress of AI agents working on my patients' cases through a visual workflow dashboard, so I can track and manage clinical tasks efficiently.

## Potential Features Expansion

7. As a healthcare administrator, I want all patient data to be automatically anonymized before processing, so we maintain HIPAA compliance and protect patient privacy.

8. As a clinician, I want to provide feedback on AI-generated results and receive improved outputs, so I can ensure accuracy and help train the system for better performance.

9. As a healthcare provider, I want secure user authentication and role-based access control, so I can safely access patient information while maintaining HIPAA compliance.

10. As a medical physicist, I want to review and validate AI-generated contours before approval, so we can ensure treatment safety and accuracy.

11. As a healthcare provider, I want to store patient data and model outputs securely in AWS, so we can maintain records while ensuring data security.

12. As an oncologist, I want automated generation of structured documentation for treatment planning, so I can reduce time spent on paperwork.

13. As a radiation therapist, I want to see the AI's decision-making process for contour generation, so I can validate its approach and ensure accuracy.

14. As a clinician, I want to compare AI-generated contours with manual contours, so I can verify accuracy and provide feedback for improvement.

15. As a healthcare administrator, I want to track usage analytics of different AI agents, so we can optimize resource allocation and improve efficiency.

16. As a radiation oncologist, I want the system to automatically identify and flag potential issues in treatment plans, so we can maintain quality assurance.

17. As a medical professional, I want to access a comprehensive patient care timeline that integrates AI agent outputs, so I can better coordinate treatment.

18. As a clinician, I want the AI to learn from my feedback and improve its performance over time, so the system becomes more accurate and efficient.

19. As a healthcare provider, I want a clean and intuitive user interface, so I can easily navigate between different AI agents and patient cases.

20. As an administrator, I want to manage and customize the workflow of AI agents based on our institution's specific needs, so we can optimize our clinical processes.
